It will be created with the context of connecting the gallery spaces at the University of Pennsylvania. There are a collection of galleries scat-tered around campus, however they are both separated by distance and also type of artwork. I want to build a website that allows users to navigate between and through the galleries.

                    <p> In order to visit all of the galleries at the University of Pennsylvania you need to walk from building to building across campus. The galleries are all scattered both by loca-tion and content. Essentially, there is no cohesive represen-tation of the galleries on Penn’s campus. I want to create an interactive online system where users can see and connect all of the galleries on campus. While creating a framework for interconnected galleries is a large problem that could in the future incorporate many galleries, I plan on using the subset of Penn galleries. How can we connect both the different locations of the galleries and the different styles of the artwork in the galleries to create an immersive gal-lery experience? 
The challenge of taking the 3d gallery spaces and con-necting the content of the gallery spaces is not a problem that has just one correct answer. I hope to create a user interface that both encourages users to explore the space while also giving them the feeling of connecting with the work. This will be an interesting user interface problem because you will have to navigate different unconnected 3d spaces in a 2d connected interface. Introducing an element of predictive viewing based on gallery view data is also an interesting problem along with incorporating this compo-nent with the user interface. 
In order to tackle this problem I plan on developing pro-totypes for how the user will interact with the website. I plan on doing user testing on the prototype and adjusting the interface accordingly. After building the framework I plan on storing the data of the users experience in the space and using the data from past users to determine paths of users through the space.  I hope to use Matterport scans of the Penn gallery spaces. While there are online 3d scans of art galleries existing, there is little research on creating a user interface connecting different galleries.&nbsp;</p>
